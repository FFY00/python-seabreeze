python-seabreeze
================

python-seabreeze is the easy way to access your Ocean Optics spectrometers from
python. It wraps the `SeaBreeze`_ library provided by Ocean Optics to communicate
with the spectrometer. If SeaBreeze is not available it can fallback to a `pyUSB`_
based reimplementation.

    This software is not associated with Ocean Optics.
    Use it at your own risk.
